# CognoRise-Infotech

This repository contains three projects that I developed during my internship at CognoRise Infotech. Each project is implemented in Java and showcases different aspects of my programming skills and knowledge.

Projects
1. Hangman Game
A classic word-guessing game where the player attempts to guess the letters in a hidden word. The game includes:

Random word selection from a predefined list
Interactive user input to guess letters
Display of the hangman figure based on incorrect guesses
Handling of game win/loss conditions
2. Library Management System
A basic system for managing a library's inventory and transactions. Features include:

Adding new books to the inventory
Removing books from the inventory
Checking out and returning books
Viewing the list of available books
3. Number Guessing Game
A simple game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. Key features include:

Random number generation
User input to guess the number
Feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct
Counting the number of attempts taken to guess the number correctly
About
This repository was created as part of my internship at CognoRise Infotech. It demonstrates my ability to develop Java applications that are interactive, user-friendly, and well-structured.

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions. Thank you
